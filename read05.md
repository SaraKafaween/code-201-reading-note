# while statement
A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:

while (condition)
  statement

If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.

The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops, and control is passed to the statement following while.

To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.

# labeled statement
A label provides a statement with an identifier that lets you refer to it elsewhere in your program. For example, you can use a label to identify a loop, and then use the break or continue statements to indicate whether a program should interrupt the loop or continue its execution.

The syntax of the labeled statement looks like the following:

label :
   statement

The value of label may be any JavaScript identifier that is not a reserved word. The statement that you identify with a label may be any statement.

# for statement
A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.

A for statement looks as follows:

for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
  statement

# do...while statement
 repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.

A do...while statement looks as follows:

do
  statement
while (condition);

statement is always executed once before the condition is checked. (To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.)  

# break statement
Use the break statement to terminate a loop, switch, or in conjunction with a labeled statement.

When you use break without a label, it terminates the innermost enclosing while, do-while, for, or switch immediately and transfers control to the following statement.
When you use break with a label, it terminates the specified labeled statement.

# continue statement
The continue statement can be used to restart a while, do-while, for, or label statement.

When you use continue without a label, it terminates the current iteration of the innermost enclosing while, do-while, or for statement and continues execution of the loop with the next iteration. In contrast to the break statement, continue does not terminate the execution of the loop entirely. In a while loop, it jumps back to the condition. In a for loop, it jumps to the increment-expression.
When you use continue with a label, it applies to the looping statement identified with that label.
The syntax of the continue statement looks like the following:

continue [label];

# for...in statement
The for...in statement iterates a specified variable over all the enumerable properties of an object. For each distinct property, JavaScript executes the specified statements. A for...in statement looks as follows:

for (variable in object)
  statement

# for...of statement
The for...of statement creates a loop Iterating over iterable objects (including Array, Map, Set, arguments object and so on), invoking a custom iteration hook with statements to be executed for the value of each distinct property.

for (variable of object)
  statement
