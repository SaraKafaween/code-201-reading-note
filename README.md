A growth mindset contrasts with a fixed mindset. The latter is the limiting belief that the capacity to learn and improve cannot be meaningfully developed. The growth mindset, conversely, is open to the effort even if it takes time.

**How to keep yourself in a growth mindset?**

1. Acknowledge and embrace imperfections.
2. View challenges as opportunities.
3. Try different learning tactics.
