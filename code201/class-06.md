# JS Object Literals; The DOM	

The Document Object Model, usually referred to as the DOM, is an essential part of making websites interactive. It is an interface that allows a programming language to manipulate the content, structure, and style of a website. JavaScript is the client-side scripting language that connects to the DOM in an internet browser.

Almost any time a website performs an action, such as rotating between a slideshow of images, displaying an error when a user attempts to submit an incomplete form, or toggling a navigation menu, it is the result of JavaScript accessing and manipulating the DOM. In this article, we will learn what the DOM is, how to work with the document object, and the difference between HTML source code and the DOM.

## What is the DOM?
+ At the most basic level, a website consists of an HTML document. The browser that you use to view the website is a program that interprets HTML and CSS and renders the style, content, and structure into the page that you see.

+ In addition to parsing the style and structure of the HTML and CSS, the browser creates a representation of the document known as the Document Object Model. This model allows JavaScript to access the text content and elements of the website document as objects.

+ JavaScript is an interactive language, and it is easier to understand new concepts by doing. Let’s create a very basic website. Create an index.html file and save it in a new project directory.

## The Document Object
+ The document object is a built-in object that has many properties and methods that we can use to access and modify websites. In order to understand how to work with the DOM, you must understand how objects work in JavaScript. Review Understanding Objects in JavaScript if you don’t feel comfortable with the concept of objects.

+ In Developer Tools on index.html, move to the Console tab. Type document into the console and press ENTER. You will see that what is output is the same as what you see in the Elements tab.
