## Transforms

The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.

Within this lesson we’ll take a look at both two-dimensional and three-dimensional transforms. Generally speaking, browser support for the transform property isn’t great, but it is getting better every day. For the best support vendor prefixes are encouraged, however you may need to download the nightly version of Chrome to see all of these transforms in action.[LEARN MORE](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/css-transforms/)

## Transitions

As mentioned, for a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.

There are four transition related properties in total, including transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay. Not all of these are required to build a transition, with the first three are the most popular.[LEARN MORE](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/transitions-animations/)

## Animation

Transitions do a great job of building out visual interactions from one state to another, and are perfect for these kinds of single state changes. However, when more control is required, transitions need to have multiple states. In return, this is where animations pick up where transitions leave off.[LEARN MORE](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/transitions-animations/)
